GS1-128 Barcode
-------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:mabbus`

The goal of this NIP is to create a decentrilized ledger of events for Supply Chain distributors for interoperability that could potentially replace AS2 messaging and VRS check.

By combining this with NIP-420 (GS1 EPCIS EVENTS) trading partners can share the data and use connected relays as validation method for serialized products.

GS1-128 (formerly known as UCC/EAN-128) is a subset of Code 128 and is used extensively worldwide in shipping and packaging industries as a product identification code for the container and pallet levels in the supply chain.

## Note event

```json
{
  "pubkey": "b2635d6a5851d3aed0cd6c495b282167acf761729478d975fc341b22650b83b3",
  "kind": 128,
  "tags": [
    ["e", <32-bytes hex of the id of nip-420 event>]
  ],
  "content": "[GS]011035432344325521171034328291[GS]1724073010BATCH123"
  ...
}
```
## Tags
By adding "e" tag we can reference the event id of the event that owns this serial or if there is a parent serial. This way there is an unlimited amount of packaging levels.
"p" tags could be used to reference a specific company.

## Content

Inside the content you will provide a GS1-128 Barcode. Barcodes are created using Application Identifies as defined here: https://www.gs1.org/standards/barcodes/application-identifiers

```json
"content": "[GS]011035432344325521171034328291[GS]1724073010BATCH123"
```

When parsed by your favorite barcode decoder, your conent would be like this:

- [01] GTIN: 10354323443255
- [10] BATCH/LOT: BATCH123
- [17] USE BY: 240730
- [21] SERIAL: 171034328291
