GS1 EPCIS Events
-------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:mabbus` `author:mabbus`

The goal of this NIP is to create a decentrilized ledger of events for Supply Chain distributors for interoperability that could potentially replace AS2 messaging and VRS check.

By combining this with NIP-128 (GS1 Serialized Items) trading partners can share the data and use connected relays as validation method for serialized products.

Here you can find reference to Vocabulary and format for the event files: https://ref.gs1.org/standards/epcis/

## Note event

```json
{
  "pubkey": "b0635d6a9851d3aed0cd6c495b282167acf761729078d975fc341b22650b07b9",
  "kind": 420,
  "content": "{\"EPCISHeader\": {\"sbdh:StandardBusinessDocumentHeader\": {..."
  ...
}
```

## Content

Inside the content you will provide a JSON object with the even Data. The schema has the same logic as your typical EPCIS sent over XML or SOAP format.

```json
{
  "EPCISHeader": {
    "sbdh:StandardBusinessDocumentHeader": {
      "sbdh:Sender": {
        "sbdh:Identifier": {
          "Authority": "GLN",
          "value": "0461223000002"
        }
      },
      "sbdh:Receiver": {
        "sbdh:Identifier": {
          "Authority": "GLN",
          "value": "0713736000001"
        }
      },
      "sbdh:DocumentIdentification": {
        "sbdh:Standard": "EPCglobal",
        "sbdh:TypeVersion": "1.0",
        "sbdh:InstanceIdentifier": "b7dd41fa-c046-461c-b8a1-0c4765af0d2a"
      }
    }
  },
  ...
}
